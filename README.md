Chess Game in C#

I recently started to learn C# and wanted to create a cool project that could help me practice.

Decide on chess game as I can practice a lot of concepts and coding it seemed like a fun challenge.
I will create the game on following MVC development.
I will start with a text view and later add a GUI, which is why I already created the project as a WPF solution.
