Chess Game in C#

I recently started to learn C# and wanted to create a cool project that could help me practice.

Decide on chess game as I can practice a lot of concepts and coding it seemed like a fun challenge.
The game is missing some of the more obscure chess moves, but you can promote Pawns.

Simple GUI made in WPF.
